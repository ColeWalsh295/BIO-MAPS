### Compare your class to other classes

***

Here, you can compare your class to the national dataset. You can:

* Compare your class' performance with the nationally collected dataset on different dimensions such as Vision & Change or on individual questions.

* Choose what classes you want to compare your class to based on the timepoint in the biology curriculum when the assessment was administered.
