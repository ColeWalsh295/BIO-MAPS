### Demographic Data

We detail below how all demographic variables used in this dashboard are determined. Students self-identify and have the option not to disclose any information, therefore the number of students in these plots may be less than the total number of students in the dataset. Note that the Capstone assessment does not record information about first generation status, major, transfer status, or the primary language spoken at home.
