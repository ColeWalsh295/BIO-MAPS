### Downloadable Data

***

By entering your unique Class ID, you can download raw data for your class.

***

This data will include raw answers for each student for each statement on the Bio-MAPS assessment. A 1 denotes that the student responded to the statement correctly, while a 0 denotes that the student responded incorrectly.

***

Timing data is also included for each page of the assessment (not available for Phys-MAPS) if you wish to use this information as an additional filter.

***

Total scores and aggregate scores across Vision & Change (and other available dimensions) are averaged over the total number of statements in that element (i.e., scores range from 0 to 1).

***

Student names and IDs are provided, but encrypted. These are unique to an individual student so students can be matched across multiple Bio-MAPS assessments and multiple administrations of an assessment. For unencrypted student names and IDs, please contact biomaps@cornell.edu with IRB approval from your institution.

***

We provide demographic demographic data as long as the included information is not identifying. If a single student lies in the intersection of any of the available demographic variables, we remove variables in the following order: (Primary Language spoken at Home, Transfer Status, Intended Major, Class Standing, First Generation Status, URM Status, Gender), until the data is not identifiable.

Note: even if demographic data is not available in the downloadable file, you may still be able to view aggregate data across these variables if no single student identified with a given group.
