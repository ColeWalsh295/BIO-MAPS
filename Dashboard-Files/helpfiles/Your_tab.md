### View of your class

***

Here, you can take a more fine-grained view of data from one of your classes. You can:

* Download raw data for your class including performance on each question and performance along different dimensions such as Vision & Change.

* View performance breakdowns on different dimensions and for individual questions across demographics

***

Note that students taking the GenBio-MAPS assessment see a random subset of questions, so the number of students responding to each question is less than or equal to the number indicated. Plots of student responses only include students who saw the question.
