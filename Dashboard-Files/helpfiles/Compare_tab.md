### Compare two of your classes

***

Here, you can compare performance for two of your classes. You can:

* Compare overall class performance on different dimensions such as Vision & Change or individual questions.

* Match data from classes to view longitudinal performance across dimensions or on individual questions.

* We are currently developing an extension of this tool where instructors can compare more than two of their classes or match data longitudinally over three or more timepoints.
