### Demographic Data

***

Demographic data is available to view in aggregate as long as there is not a single student that identifies with a particular group (i.e., data cannot be broken down by transfer status if only one student in the dataset identifies as a transfer student).

Below, we detail how all demographic variables are determined. Students self-identify and have the option not to disclose any information, therefore the number of students in these plots may be less than the total number of students in the dataset.

***

Gender: students can select (Female, Male, Self-describe). Only students who self-identify as female or male are presented as data from students who self-describe is identifying.

***

URM Status: students can select multiple from (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, White, Self-describe). When determining URM status students who identify as white or asian are considered to be in the majority group. Students who identify as american indian or alaska native, black or african american, hispanic or latinx, native hawaiian or other pacific islander or multiple ethnic backgrounds are considered URMs.

***

First Generation Status: students are considered first generation students if neither of their parents graduated college.

***

Class Standing: Postbaccalaureate are not included in the dataset.

***

Major: Students who plan to declare a major in biology or any other life science are included in the group of Biology majors.

***

Transfer Status: Students indicate whether they are a transfer student.

***

Primary Language spoken at Home: Students indicate whether their primary language spoken at home growing up was english or another language.
